**Message:** wip

This commit appears to be a work-in-progress, primarily refactoring client-related code, especially around how client configurations and prompts are handled, and making some functions `pub` (public).

### Changes in `src/client/bedrock.rs`
*   **Removed `PROMPTS` constant:** The `PROMPTS` array, which defined prompt actions for `access_key_id`, `secret_access_key`, and `region`, has been removed. This suggests a more dynamic or centralized way of handling prompts might be introduced elsewhere, or that these prompts are no longer directly associated with the `BedrockClient` in this manner.

### Changes in `src/client/claude.rs`
*   **Minor formatting/whitespace changes:** The changes in this file are primarily whitespace adjustments within the `claude_chat_completions_streaming` function, specifically around the `handler.tool_call` line. The logic remains the same.

### Changes in `src/client/common.rs`
*   **`noop_prepare_embeddings` made `async`:** The `noop_prepare_embeddings` function, which previously returned an error indicating that the client doesn't support embeddings, has been changed from a synchronous `fn` to an asynchronous `async fn`. This aligns its signature with other `prepare_embeddings` functions that might perform asynchronous operations.

### Changes in `src/client/gemini.rs`
*   **Changed `vertexai` import:** The import `use super::vertexai::*` was changed to `use crate::client::vertexai::*`. This changes the import from a relative path to an absolute path within the crate, which can help with module resolution and clarity in larger projects.
*   **`get_api_base` made `pub` and refactored:** The `get_api_base` function, which retrieves the API base URL, has been made `pub` (public). Its implementation has been refactored to explicitly check for an environment variable first, then the config's `api_base`, and finally return an error if neither is found. Previously, it used a `config_get_fn!` macro which likely handled this logic implicitly.

### Changes in `src/client/macros.rs`
*   **`register_client!` macro changes:**
    *   **`mod $module;` to `pub mod $module;`:** Modules generated by the macro are now `pub` (public), making them accessible from outside the `client` module.
    *   **`PROMPTS` constant type changed:** The `PROMPTS` constant within the generated client `impl` block has been changed from `[PromptAction<'static>; 0]` to `&[PromptAction<'static>]`. This makes it a slice reference, which is more flexible.
    *   **`create_client_config` prompt argument:** The `create_client_config` function now passes `&$client::PROMPTS` instead of `&self.prompts()` to `create_config`. This means it's using the static `PROMPTS` constant directly rather than a method call.
    *   **`config_get_fn!` macro `pub`:** The `config_get_fn!` macro now generates `pub fn` instead of `fn`, making the generated getter functions public.

### Changes in `src/client/mod.rs`
*   **`register_client!` macro arguments updated:** The `register_client!` macro calls for various clients (e.g., `openai`, `gemini`, `claude`) have been updated to include an empty `[]` for the `PROMPTS` argument, reflecting the change in the macro definition.
*   **`vertexai` client added to `register_client!`:** The `vertexai` client is now explicitly registered with its `PROMPTS` defined.
*   **`impl_client_trait!` calls added for all clients:** Explicit `impl_client_trait!` calls have been added for `OpenAIClient`, `OpenAICompatibleClient`, `GeminiClient`, `ClaudeClient`, `CohereClient`, `AzureOpenAIClient`, and `VertexAIClient`. This suggests a more explicit and structured way of implementing the `Client` trait for each client, moving away from implicit macro-based implementations for the trait itself.

### Changes in `src/client/openai_compatible.rs`
*   **`prepare_rerank` `self_.name()` to `Self::name(&self_.config)`:** In the `prepare_rerank` function, the call to `self_.name()` was changed to `Self::name(&self_.config)`. This means it's now using the static `name` function associated with the `OpenAICompatibleClient` type, passing its configuration, rather than an instance method.

### Changes in `src/client/vertexai.rs`
*   **`config_get_fn!` removed and manual `pub fn` added:** Similar to `gemini.rs`, the `config_get_fn!` macro calls for `project_id` and `location` have been removed. Instead, manual `pub fn get_project_id` and `pub fn get_location` implementations are provided, explicitly handling environment variables and config values.
*   **`PROMPTS` constant removed:** The `PROMPTS` array for `VertexAIClient` has been removed, similar to `BedrockClient`.
*   **`Client` trait implementation removed:** The entire `impl Client for VertexAIClient` block has been removed. This implies that the `Client` trait implementation is now handled by the `impl_client_trait!` macro in `src/client/mod.rs`.
*   **`prepare_chat_completions` and `prepare_embeddings` made `pub async fn`:** These functions are now public and asynchronous. The `prepare_chat_completions` function also removes the `model_category` argument, instead deriving it internally from `self_.model().real_name()`.
*   **`embeddings` made `pub async fn`:** The `embeddings` function is now public and asynchronous.

### Changes in `src/config/input.rs`
*   **`create_client` made `async` and `authenticator` argument added:** The `create_client` function is now `async` and takes an additional `authenticator` argument (which is `None` in this commit). This change propagates to `fetch_chat_text`, which now `await`s `create_client`.

### Changes in `src/main.rs`
*   **`handle_auth_command` argument changed:** The `handle_auth_command` function now takes `auth_command.command` instead of `auth_command`. This indicates a deeper nesting of the command structure.
*   **`create_client` call updated:** The `create_client` calls in `start_directive` and `shell_execute` now `await` the function and pass `None` for the new `authenticator` argument.

### Changes in `src/rag/mod.rs`
*   **`init_client` calls updated:** The `init_client` calls in `Rag::rerank` and `Rag::embeddings` now pass `None` for the new `authenticator` argument.

### Changes in `src/repl/mod.rs`
*   **`create_client` call updated:** The `create_client` call in `ask` now `await`s the function.

### Changes in `src/serve.rs`
*   **`init_client` calls updated:** The `init_client` calls in `Server::chat_completions`, `Server::embeddings`, and `Server::rerank` now pass `None` for the new `authenticator` argument.

**Message:** feat: Implement interactive OAuth and Gemini credential import

This is a significant feature commit, introducing interactive OAuth authentication for Gemini, credential management, and related infrastructure.

### Changes in `.gitmodules`
*   **Added new submodule entries:**
    *   `oauth_review/r-google-oauth2` pointing to `https://github.com/mass10/r-google-oauth2/`
    *   `oauth_review/rs-gapi-oauth` pointing to `https://github.com/mass10/rs-gapi-oauth/`
    This indicates that external OAuth libraries are being integrated as Git submodules.

### Changes in `Cargo.lock`
*   **Updated dependencies:** Numerous dependencies have been added or updated, reflecting the new OAuth and testing functionalities. Notable additions include `assert_cmd`, `oauth2`, `open`, `predicates`, `tempfile`, and various related crates.

### Changes in `Cargo.toml`
*   **Added new dependencies:**
    *   `oauth2 = { version = "5.0.0", features = ["reqwest"], default-features = false }`
    *   `open = "5.0"`
*   **Updated `reqwest` version:** `reqwest` was updated from `0.12.0` to `0.12.12`.
*   **Added `dev-dependencies`:**
    *   `predicates = "3.1.0"`
    *   `assert_cmd = "2.0.14"`
    *   `tempfile = "3.10.1"`
    *   `aichat = { path = "." }` (for integration testing)
*   **Removed `opt-level = "z"` newline:** A minor formatting change, removing a newline at the end of the file.

### Added files in `oauth_review/`
*   **`oauth_review/r-google-oauth2` and `oauth_review/rs-gapi-oauth`:** These are new submodule entries, indicating the inclusion of external OAuth-related Rust projects.

### Added files in `src/auth/`
This is an entirely new module dedicated to authentication.

*   **`src/auth/credential_store.rs`:** Defines `Credentials` struct (access token, refresh token, expiry, user info) and `CredentialStore` struct for reading, writing, and clearing credentials from a JSON file (`oauth_creds.json`) located in a `.zos` directory within the user's home directory.
*   **`src/auth/mod.rs`:** Defines the `Authenticator` trait with an `authenticate` method that returns an access token. It also provides a basic `ApiKeyAuthenticator` implementation and re-exports modules from `oauth_split`.
*   **`src/auth/oauth.rs`:** A simple module re-exporting `oauth_split`.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/constants.rs`:** Defines OAuth client ID, client secret (placeholders), and the OAuth scopes required.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/find_available_port.rs`:** A utility function `find_available_port` to find an available TCP port on localhost, used for the OAuth redirect URI.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/mod.rs`:** Re-exports all sub-modules within `oauth_split`.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/oauth_authenticator_impl_fetch_and_cache_user_info.rs`:** Implements `fetch_and_cache_user_info` for `OAuthAuthenticator`, which fetches user information from Google's OAuth2 API and updates the stored credentials.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/oauth_authenticator_impl_get_token_from_web_flow.rs`:** Implements `get_token_from_web_flow` for `OAuthAuthenticator`. This is the core of the interactive OAuth flow:
    *   Constructs an OAuth2 client.
    *   Generates PKCE code challenge.
    *   Finds an available port for the redirect URI.
    *   Constructs the authorization URL and opens it in the user's browser using the `open` crate.
    *   Starts a TCP listener to receive the redirect callback.
    *   Parses the authorization code and state from the redirect URL.
    *   Exchanges the authorization code for an access token and refresh token.
    *   Calls `fetch_and_cache_user_info`.
    *   Sends a success message back to the browser.
    *   Returns the obtained `Credentials`.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/oauth_authenticator_impl_new.rs`:** Implements the `new` constructor for `OAuthAuthenticator`.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/oauth_authenticator_impl_refresh_token.rs`:** Implements `refresh_token` for `OAuthAuthenticator`, using the refresh token to obtain a new access token.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/oauth_authenticator_struct.rs`:** Defines the `OAuthAuthenticator` struct, holding `OAuthConfig` and a shared `CredentialStore`.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/oauth_authenticator_trait_impl_authenticate.rs`:** Implements the `Authenticator` trait for `OAuthAuthenticator`. This function attempts to:
    1.  Read cached credentials.
    2.  If credentials exist and are expired, try to refresh the token.
    3.  If no credentials or refresh fails, initiate the interactive web flow (`get_token_from_web_flow`).
    4.  Stores the new credentials.
    5.  Returns the access token.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/oauth_config.rs`:** Defines a placeholder `OAuthConfig` struct for client ID and secret.
*   **`src/auth/oauth_split/user_info.rs`:** Defines a `UserInfo` struct to store user email and other potential info.

### Changes in `src/cli.rs`
*   **Added `command` field to `Cli`:** A new `command` field of type `Option<Commands>` is added to the `Cli` struct, allowing for subcommands.
*   **Added `Commands` enum:** Defines `Auth(AuthCommands)` as a subcommand.
*   **Added `AuthCommands` struct:** Defines `command` field of type `AuthSubcommands`.
*   **Added `AuthSubcommands` enum:** Defines `Login` as a subcommand under `auth`. This sets up the CLI structure for `aichat auth login`.

### Changes in `src/client/azure_openai.rs`, `src/client/claude.rs`, `src/client/cohere.rs`, `src/client/gemini.rs`, `src/client/openai.rs`, `src/client/openai_compatible.rs`, `src/client/vertexai.rs`
*   **Removed `PROMPTS` constants:** The `PROMPTS` constants are removed from individual client structs. This is consistent with the `0d92d5b` commit which moved prompt handling to the `register_client!` macro.
*   **Removed `impl_client_trait!` calls:** The explicit `impl_client_trait!` blocks are removed from these files, as they are now centralized in `src/client/mod.rs`.
*   **`prepare_*` functions made `pub async fn`:** All `prepare_chat_completions`, `prepare_embeddings`, and `prepare_rerank` functions in these client modules are now `pub async fn`, ensuring they are public and asynchronous.
*   **`gemini.rs` authentication change:** In `gemini.rs`, `prepare_chat_completions` and `prepare_embeddings` now obtain the `api_key` from `self_.authenticator.authenticate().await?` instead of `self_.get_api_key()`. This integrates the new authentication system.
*   **`openai_compatible.rs` `name()` to `Self::name(&self_.config)`:** Similar to the previous commit, `self_.name()` is changed to `Self::name(&self_.config)` in `prepare_rerank`.
*   **`vertexai.rs` `config_get_fn!` removed:** The `config_get_fn!` macro calls for `project_id` and `location` are removed, as manual `pub fn` implementations were added in the previous commit.

### Changes in `src/client/common.rs`
*   **Added `prompts` method to `Client` trait:** The `Client` trait now has a default `prompts` method that returns an empty slice. This allows clients to provide their specific prompts.
*   **`set_client_models_config`, `select_model`, `prompt_input_string` made `pub`:** These utility functions are now public.

### Changes in `src/client/macros.rs`
*   **`register_client!` macro updated:**
    *   The `register_client!` macro now takes an additional `authenticator` argument in the `init` function for clients, allowing an `Option<std::sync::Arc<dyn Authenticator + Send + Sync>>` to be passed.
    *   The `Client` struct generated by the macro now includes an `authenticator` field.
    *   The `init_client` function generated by the macro also takes an `authenticator` argument and passes it down to the client `init` calls.
    *   The `impl Client for $crate::client::$client` block now includes the `prompts` method implementation, returning `Self::PROMPTS`.
    *   The `prepare_*` functions within the `impl_client_trait!` macro now `await` their calls, reflecting their new `async` nature.

### Changes in `src/client/mod.rs`
*   **`Authenticator` import:** `use crate::auth::Authenticator;` is added.
*   **`register_client!` macro calls updated:** All `register_client!` macro calls are updated to include the `PROMPTS` argument, which was previously removed from individual client files. This centralizes the prompt definitions.
*   **`impl_client_trait!` calls added:** Explicit `impl_client_trait!` calls are added for all clients, defining how they implement the `Client` trait, including their `prepare_*` functions and `chat_completions` methods.

### Changes in `src/main.rs`
*   **`auth` module import:** `mod auth;` is added.
*   **`Authenticator` and `OAuthAuthenticator` imports:** Necessary imports for the new authentication system are added.
*   **`handle_auth_command` function:** This new `async` function is introduced to handle `auth` subcommands.
    *   For `cli::AuthSubcommands::Login`, it creates an `OAuthConfig` (with placeholder client ID/secret), a `CredentialStore`, and an `OAuthAuthenticator`.
    *   It then calls `oauth_authenticator.authenticate().await` to perform the OAuth flow and prints the access token or an error.
*   **`cli.command` handling:** The `main` function now checks `cli.command` and calls `handle_auth_command` if an `Auth` command is present, then exits.
*   **`create_client` calls updated:** The `create_client` calls in `start_directive` and `shell_execute` now pass `None` for the `authenticator` argument.

### Added file `test_oauth.sh`
*   A new shell script `test_oauth.sh` is added, which runs `cargo run -- auth login` in the background and redirects output to `oauth_output.txt`. This is likely for testing the OAuth flow.

### Added files in `tests/`
This is a new test suite for the OAuth flow.

*   **`tests/oauth_flow.rs`:** The main integration test file for the OAuth login success scenario. It uses `assert_cmd` and `predicates` for testing. It sets up a temporary environment, runs the `aichat auth login` command, simulates the OAuth callback, verifies the credentials, and cleans up.
*   **`tests/oauth_flow_parts/cleanup.rs`:** Contains `cleanup_test_environment` to remove the temporary directory.
*   **`tests/oauth_flow_parts/command_execution.rs`:** Contains `run_aichat_login_command` to execute the `aichat auth login` command.
*   **`tests/oauth_flow_parts/mod.rs`:** Re-exports all sub-modules within `oauth_flow_parts`.
*   **`tests/oauth_flow_parts/oauth_callback.rs`:** Contains `find_available_port` (re-exported from `src/auth/oauth_split`) and `simulate_oauth_callback` which makes an HTTP request to the temporary web server to simulate the OAuth redirect.
*   **`tests/oauth_flow_parts/setup.rs`:** Contains `setup_test_environment` to create a temporary directory and set the `HOME` environment variable for the test, ensuring credentials are written to a controlled location.
*   **`tests/oauth_flow_parts/verification.rs`:** Contains `verify_oauth_success` to assert that the command exited successfully, `oauth_creds.json` was created, and its content contains expected fields.

In summary, the first commit (`wip`) primarily focuses on refactoring the client architecture to be more modular and to support asynchronous operations and a more flexible prompt system. The second commit (`feat: Implement interactive OAuth...`) builds upon this by introducing a comprehensive OAuth authentication system, including credential storage, web-based login flow, and a dedicated test suite.
