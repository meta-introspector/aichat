# War Council Strategies: The Configuration Module (`src/config`)

In the ongoing campaign of AIChat, the Configuration Module (`src/config`) serves as our War Council, where all strategic directives and operational parameters are meticulously planned and recorded. Just as a successful campaign relies on adaptable and well-defined strategies, AIChat's behavior is precisely shaped by the settings managed within this crucial module.

The beauty of this War Council lies in its organized approach to defining our operational doctrine:

*   **The Grand Strategy Document (`src/config/mod.rs`):** This central document outlines the overarching strategy for the entire campaign. It aggregates all specific directives, providing a unified view of how AIChat operates and interacts with its environment.
*   **Agent Directives (`src/config/agent.rs`):** These directives define the specific behaviors and parameters for our specialized AI agents. They dictate how agents should act, what resources they can utilize, and their overall mission profiles.
*   **Input Protocols (`src/config/input.rs`):** This section details the protocols for receiving intelligence and commands from various sources. It ensures that all incoming information is correctly interpreted and processed, regardless of its origin.
*   **Role Definitions (`src/config/role.rs`):** Here, we define the various roles our AI units can assume on the battlefield. Each role comes with a predefined set of behaviors, communication styles, and operational guidelines, allowing us to quickly adapt to different tactical situations.
*   **Session Logs (`src/config/session.rs`):** These logs maintain a continuous record of our ongoing engagements. They ensure continuity in our operations, allowing us to pick up where we left off and maintain context across extended campaigns.

The Configuration Module is the strategic brain of AIChat, enabling us to fine-tune its behavior, adapt to changing conditions, and ensure that every action aligns with our overarching campaign goals. Its clear and organized structure allows for precise control and rapid adjustments, making AIChat a truly adaptable and effective tool on the digital battlefield.
